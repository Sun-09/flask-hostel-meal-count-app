# Hostel meal counting app

This is a basic hostel mealcounting app.For a normal hostel meal counting system one person is assigned to take meal count of every room's of hostel. This takes burden of that person and he had to go every room in the hostel and ask the number of person will eat in the hostel in next day. This is a time-consuming process. That's why I built the app that helps us to get rid of the problem.

# Languages Used 

Python (As it is a flask app)
HTML
CSS
Javascript

**Note:- Here I used Bootstap . That uses CSS and Javascript along with HTML. So there is no other .css or .js file.**

# IDLE's used 

vsCode (install from here - https://code.visualstudio.com/


# Basic Interface of the app

# How to Use

**It is a very easy to use web application with basic features -**

1. First we have to Enter Room no, Lunch and Dinner;s meal count, Border's name for lunch and Dinner and submit.
2. Then it will be shown as a table.( Border's name will not shown)
3. You can add as many number of meal count as you want.
4. You can update and delete your existing meal count
5. You can see border's list who are appling for meal(lunch & Dinner)

# How it works

Here the basic data flow is given in the diagram :-

The structure of a flask based web app is given below:-

**Client:** It is a generally a web-browser where we input the data. Client request to the server using get or post methods...

**Server:** It is generally a virtual system where all the data of user is stored. When it necessary user can request the data to get back.

**Flask API** Client and Server is connected with the Flask API.




# Why use Flask

Flask is a popular web framework in Python used for building web applications and APIs. It is lightweight, flexible, and easy to use, which makes it an ideal choice for building backend systems.

Here are some reasons why Flask is commonly used for backend development:

**Simplicity:** Flask is simple and easy to learn, making it ideal for beginners to get started with backend development.

**Flexibility:** Flask is a micro-framework, which means it is lightweight and has minimal dependencies. This makes it highly flexible and allows developers to add or remove features based on their specific needs.

**Extensibility:** Flask has a large number of extensions and plugins available, which makes it easy to add additional functionality such as authentication, database connectivity, and more.

**Scalability:** Flask applications can be easily scaled horizontally by running multiple instances of the same application behind a load balancer.

**Integration:** Flask integrates well with other Python libraries and tools, making it easy to build complex applications with a variety of different components.

**Overall, Flask is a powerful tool for backend development in Python, offering simplicity, flexibility, and scalability for a wide range of use cases.**
